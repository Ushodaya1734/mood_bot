# mood_bot
Our proposed system is implemented as an application which can be run on 
the users desktop and its main focus is to reliably determine the users mood.
 The chatbot identifies the user's sentiment by chat conversation with the user. 
Based on the input provided by the user, current emotion or mood is analyzed by
the chatbot and it will suggest song to the user. 
The objective of our application is to identify the mood expressed
by the user and once the mood is identified, songs are played by the application.
It plays the music at the background.
